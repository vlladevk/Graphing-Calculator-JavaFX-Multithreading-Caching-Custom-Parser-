Graphing Calculator (JavaFX, Multithreading, Caching, Custom Parser)

Overview

Graphing Calculator is a powerful and interactive function plotter built with JavaFX.
It leverages multithreading, caching, and a custom mathematical expression parser with AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) construction to efficiently render mathematical functions.
This project demonstrates proficiency in UI development, performance optimization, and algorithm design.

Key Features

JavaFX UI – Modern and responsive interface with smooth animations, 
Custom Expression Parser – Parses mathematical expressions and builds an AST for evaluation, 
Graph Rendering – Dynamic function visualization with zoom and pan support, 
Multithreading – Background computation of function points for seamless UI experience, 
Caching System – Stores previously computed function values for performance boost, 
Real-time Updates – Functions update instantly as the user types, 
Unit Tests – Comprehensive JUnit tests for expression parsing and evaluation.

Technologies Used
Java 17+, 
JavaFX for UI, 
ExecutorService for parallel computation, 
Regex-based Lexical Analysis for parsing, 
AST-based Expression Evaluation, 
Canvas API for custom graph rendering, 
JUnit 5 for unit testing.


Usage Guide
Enter a function (e.g., sin(x) + cos(2*x)) in the input field, 
Press Enter or click Add Function to plot it, 
Zoom in/out using the mouse scroll, 
Pan the graph by dragging with the mouse, 
Remove functions by clicking the delete button, 

Future Improvements
Implement customizable themes, 
Export graphs as images, 
More advanced error handling,
